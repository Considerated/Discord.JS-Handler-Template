## Installation

### ✅ Setting up:
*  First, locate the `config.json` file in `config/config.json`
* Go to [the discord developer center](https://discord.com/developers), and create a new application, along with a bot and then invite it to your server.
* Copy the Token of the bot and paste it in the `config.json` file.
* Enter your prefix too!

#### Step 2:
* When you're done setting up your token and prefix, make sure to customize your bot like the bot's embed colour and it's footer.
* Now, comes up installing required modules. If you don't want the trouble of learning the dependencies and understanding it, just run `npm install`.
* You're good to go! Run `node .` to run the bot!
